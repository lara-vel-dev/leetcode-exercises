'''
-- 66. Plus One -- 
You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. 
The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. 
The large integer does not contain any leading 0's.
Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.

Examples:
Input: digits = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,4]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 123.
Incrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124.
Thus, the result should be [1,2,4].

Input: digits = [9]
Output: [1,0]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 9.
Incrementing by one gives 9 + 1 = 10.
Thus, the result should be [1,0].

Constraints:
* 1 <= digits.length <= 100
* 0 <= digits[i] <= 9
* digits does not contain any leading 0's.
